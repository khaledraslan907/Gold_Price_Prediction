# Gold_Price_Prediction
# Gold_Price_prediction by Random forest Regressor
This project involves predicting gold prices using a Random Forest Regressor model. The dataset used contains various features that can influence gold prices, and the goal is to leverage these features to make accurate predictions.
# Project Overview:
# 1- Loading the Dataset:
The dataset is loaded using the pandas library. This step involves reading the dataset file into a DataFrame, which allows for easy manipulation and analysis.
# 2- Exploring and Describing the Data:
Several methods are employed to understand the dataset better as head, tail, shape, describe and info.
# 3- Correlation Analysis:
The dataset is analyzed to determine the correlations between different features. A heat map is constructed to visually represent these correlations, helping to identify which features are most strongly related to gold prices.
# 4- Distribution Check:
The distribution of the data is checked to understand the underlying patterns and ensure that the data is suitable for regression modeling.
# 5- Splitting the Data:
The dataset is divided into training and testing sets using the train_test_split function. This step is crucial for evaluating the performance of the model on unseen data.
# 6- Building and Training the Model:
A Random Forest Regressor model is built and trained on the training set. This ensemble learning method uses multiple decision trees to improve the accuracy and robustness of the predictions.
# 7- Model Evaluation:
The performance of the model is evaluated by plotting the actual gold prices against the predicted prices. This visual comparison helps in assessing how well the model is performing.
